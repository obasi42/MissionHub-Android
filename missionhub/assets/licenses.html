Addition: If you use Universal Image Loader code in your application you must mention it in application UI with string "Used Universal-Image-Loader (c) 2011-2012, Sergey Tarasevich" (e.g. in some "About" section). If you don't want or you can't do it then you can make request for permission not to mention Universal Image Loader in your app. Email: nostra13[at]gmail[dot]com. Also I will be grateful to you if you'll allow to mention your application at Univeral Image Loader page on Github (https://github.com/nostra13/Android-Universal-Image-Loader) in "Applications using Universal Image Loader" section.</pre>
